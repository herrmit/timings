Yet another time logging utility...

## Why another one?
All those utilities I have found so far do not work the way I want. At least not exactly. 

Most of them were too much for me: I only want to create projects, start working, stop working and see the summary. That's it.

I do not need any graphical evaluation and I do not want to maintain the database with the code.

Instead I want to have a siiimple text file which can easily be manipulated.

And another reason: that should be fairly easy and fun to implement. Indeed, it was.
